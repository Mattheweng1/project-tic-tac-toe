TOP Project

This project was part of The Odin Project where I chose to learn my foundational skills for full stack development.

The purpose of this project was to learn to use modules and factory functions to keep variables and functions private and to organize the code more clearly. I also learned the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to implement it into an unbeatable AI for the player to play against if they so choose.

**Have fun! :)**
