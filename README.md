# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a website to play the classic game of tic-tac-toe! Play a friend locally or challenge one of the bots! Unfortunately, one of them is unbeatable. Why not try a game?

Click [here](https://mattheweng1.github.io/project-tic-tac-toe/) to check out the deployed application.

## Features

- Two players can play locally.
- There are two bots you can challenge. One just plays randomly, but the other can't actually be beaten (it uses the minimax algorithm).
- Choose the names of your players.
- The score between players will be kept until the players are changed.

## Note

This project was built as part of my web development journey on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

The purpose of this project was to learn to use modules and factory functions to keep variables and functions private and to organize the code more clearly. I also learned the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to implement it into an efficient, unbeatable AI.

**Have fun! :)**
